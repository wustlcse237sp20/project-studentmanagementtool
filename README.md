## Student Management Tool

* What user stories were completed this iteration?
  * A simple GPA calculator was created, which will hopefully be implemented in User Interface once that is ironed out. This will allow students to calculate their GPA by just entering how many courses they took, the grades they received for those courses, and the credits they received for those courses.
  * A basic User Interface has been completed, which will allow the user easier access to the tools we are creating

* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  * We still want to create an activity tracker, a news feed, and a stats page so that users can track the global pandemic easier while also trying to maintain a decent schedule

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  * Our interface doesn't necessarily work yet, but we will be working on it

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  * To run the GPA calculator, in the src folder of our project, run the command 'java GPACalculator.java' and the program will run

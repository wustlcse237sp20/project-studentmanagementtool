## Student Management Tool

* What user stories were completed this iteration?
  * A simple GPA calculator was created, which will hopefully be implemented in User Interface once that is ironed out. This will allow students to calculate their GPA by just entering how many courses they took, the grades they received for those courses, and the credits they received for those courses.
  * A basic User Interface has been completed, which will allow the user easier access to the tools we are creating
  * In the basic User Interface, there is a news feed that contains news about Covid-19 from both CNN and BBC. The user can double click on any news story and they will be taken to a web browser where they can read the article.

* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  * We still want to create an activity tracker, some sort of scheduler, and a stats page. We also need to add the tools that we created to the User Interface, so that our page can be a Toolbox like we intended.

* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  * Our interface is not complete yet, but we will be working on it. We need to work on wrapping for the news headlines, a refresh button for the news headlines, and we also need to add GUI components for our other tools.

* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  * To run the GPA calculator, in the src folder of our project, run the command 'java GPACalculator.java' and the program will run. To run the UI interface, go to the src folder and run StudentManagerUI.java.
